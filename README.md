# Mindrian

An AI-driven, agentic deep-research platform that transforms how individuals, teams, and organizations innovate by uncovering non-obvious connections and accelerating insight generation.

## The Problem

Innovation cycle time and quality are critical to survival and growth, yet innovation remains messy, sporadic, and structureless. The bottleneck isn't expertise—it's **cognitive bandwidth**.

Human cognition cannot simultaneously process:
- All relevant domain knowledge
- Cutting-edge research and cross-domain advances
- Organizational goals and constraints
- Multi-dimensional relationships across disparate fields

Even brilliant teams miss original, non-obvious connections—not from lack of knowledge, but from structural cognitive limits. Current AI systems fall short with rigid roles, static logic, and inability to generalize across domains.

## The Solution

Mindrian transforms static thinking frameworks into **adaptive, executable cognitive agents** that:

- **Dynamically adjust roles** between tools and orchestrators based on context
- **Continuously enhance intelligence** through recursive composition and contextual reasoning
- **Enable human-in-the-loop learning** for evolving system capabilities
- **Uncover intersectional innovations** by revealing hidden connections across distant domains

## Why It Matters

Organizations waste time, capital, and opportunities on fragile, episodic innovation. Exploratory thinking is expensive but critical for breakthroughs. Mindrian enables you to:

- **Perceive faulty assumptions** and incoherent conclusions early
- **Identify missed research** and cutting-edge developments
- **Discover non-obvious connections** that drive disruptive innovation
- **Move from vague insights to investable opportunities** systematically

By raising the quality of ideation through AI-driven deep research that asks the right questions, stress-tests assumptions, and reveals unexpected relationships, Mindrian makes continuous, institutionalized innovation possible.

## Getting Started

### Frontend Sandbox

The `frontend/` directory serves as a sandbox for developing and testing Mindrian components. It's built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and BlockNote editor.

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun package manager

#### Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   # or
   bun run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

#### Available Scripts
